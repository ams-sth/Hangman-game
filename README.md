Hangman is a word guessing game, playable among two or more players. 
The word to be guessed is represented by a line of dashes, addressing each letter of the word. 
The aim is to save the individual from hanging by guessing the word correctly. 
In this game, the player guesses the missing letters of a word; one letter at a time. 
Each correct word will be filled in the blanks and is rewarded with a life. 
However, If the guessed letter is wrong, then the player loses a chance. 
The chances are tracked by a stick figure; each incorrect word compels to draw a body part, one at a time.
If the whole figure is drawn before guessing the word, the stick figure ends up being completed and hung up on the scaffold.
And so, the guesser losses and an image of crying hangman is shown on the screen. 
However, if the player correctly guesses out all the letters of the word before the time runs out, the player wins the game.
